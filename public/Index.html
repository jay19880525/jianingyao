						I am a doctoral student of Operations Resarch in Rutgers University. Under supervision of Prof. Andrzej Ruszczyński , I mainly study stochastic optimization theory, numerical methods and applications. In particular, I work on continuous-time optimal control with risk-aversion via forwad backward stochastic differential equations(FBSDE). Besides, I am also interested in financial engineering, specialized in fixed income and credit risk modeling. As hobby, I like programming for artificial intelligence and machine learning. </p>
						<p>Currently, I am doing my internship, in Numerix, LLC,  as a financial engineer. I was doing researches on the model risk caused by prevailing negative rates in Japan and some European countries, including curve construction, volatility cube interpolation and sensitivity analysis. I also study calibrations of various models for different asset classes, especially stochastic-Alpha-Beta-Rho (SABR) model and its variants.

					<p>In 1960, Carl Reiner shot the pilot for a comedy series titled “Head of the Family,” starring Carl Reiner. The show was about a writer who lived with his family in New Rochelle, New York and commuted to his job in Manhattan, writing on a TV comedy show. “Head of the Family” aired only once. So Carl had moved on, until Sheldon Leonard came along and said they would not fail this time because, “we’ll get a better actor to play you.” And thus, “The Dick Van Dyke Show” was born. </p>
