					<p>In 1960, Carl Reiner shot the pilot for a comedy series titled “Head of the Family,” starring Carl Reiner. The show was about a writer who lived with his family in New Rochelle, New York and commuted to his job in Manhattan, writing on a TV comedy show. “Head of the Family” aired only once. So Carl had moved on, until Sheldon Leonard came along and said they would not fail this time because, “we’ll get a better actor to play you.” And thus, “The Dick Van Dyke Show” was born. </p>
